# Flight Ticket analysis based on a US Dataset

I analysed this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices

the .ipynb jupyter notebook is using the 2 million version of this dataset


1. you can dowload the snappy parquet version of the dataset, and then use the flights_data.py to generate the size of rows you desire: "2 million or 3 million or etc. "

2. then you can use the `final-analysis.py` to generate the graphs to your system. OR use the `final analysis jupyter notebook` to make this project work 😊
